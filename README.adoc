= Github Asciidoc Example

== Welcome!

This is an example file of what you can do with asciidoc as rendered on github.
It is basically a gist except that gists don't render asciidoc like files do.

== Admonitions

[NOTE]
====
A sample note admonition.
We can use gemoji icons in the Asciidoctor markup.
We assign an icon name to the document
attributes `tip-caption`, `note-caption` and `important-caption`.
====
 
TIP: It works!
 
IMPORTANT: Asciidoctor is awesome, don't forget!
 
CAUTION: Don't forget to add the `...-caption` document attributes in the header of the document on GitHub.
 
WARNING: You have no reason not to use Asciidoctor.

== Source Code Rendering

Here is an example of some R code.

[source,r]
----
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))  # divide graph area in 2 columns
boxplot(cars$speed, main="Speed", sub=paste("Outlier rows: ", boxplot.stats(cars$speed)$out))  # box plot for 'speed'
boxplot(cars$dist, main="Distance", sub=paste("Outlier rows: ", boxplot.stats(cars$dist)$out))  # box plot for 'distance'
----

== Diagramming

Asciidoc has a diagramming plugin that renders either

* PlantUML
* ditaa
* GraphViz dot

However this is not turned on within Github.

@startuml
class Car
Driver - Car : drives >
Car *- Wheel : have 4 >
Car -- Person : < owns
@enduml

== Future additions

* TOCs
* Images
* Tables as an example of CSV/data layout
* Footnotes
* Lack of includes - include vs link
* Attributes
* Source Code - show _rout_ output
* Source Code - add callouts
* Custom macros (menu, btn, kbd, and icon)
