= Github Asciidoc Example

== Welcome!

This is an example file of what you can do with asciidoc as rendered on github.
It is basically a gist except that gists don't render asciidoc like files do.

== Admonitions

[NOTE]
====
A sample note admonition.
We can use gemoji icons in the Asciidoctor markup.
We assign an icon name to the document
attributes `tip-caption`, `note-caption` and `important-caption`.
====
 
TIP: It works!
 
IMPORTANT: Asciidoctor is awesome, don't forget!
 
CAUTION: Don't forget to add the `...-caption` document attributes in the header of the document on GitHub.
 
WARNING: You have no reason not to use Asciidoctor.
